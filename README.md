# Visualizing Facial Competence Scores

A visualization of facial competence scores from Todorov et al's 2005 Science publication.

This shows the relationship between the competence measures from a brief exposure of a candidate's face and the election outcomes for that candidate. A dummy variable for the election being held before or after 2003 is included in an interactive visualization of the regression surface:

election outcome ~ facial competence + after 2003.
